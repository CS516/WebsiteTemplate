# Homework 1: Website Requirements

## General Theme
For example: photo gallery, recipe repository, Twitter clone, e-commerce inventory, API-driven data mining, generic wedding,
message board for the class, dentistry, etc.

## Purpose and functionality
For example: draw customers to a photography business by showing a portfolio, pricing, contact information, and booking. 
Mine data from IMDB to answer questions about movies and movie stars. Forum to facilitate communication between users. Etc.

## Target audience
For example: The general public, family members, research scientists, students, etc.

## Users
What users will log in into your website? Your website is required to have a login feature. It is not necessary to require
a login to use the site (unless your theme demands it), your website can merely require a login for certain features.

For example, storing user preferences, order history, admin logins to manage data like image galleries, etc.
What sort of data will it manage? This doesn’t include static data, such as logos, headers, and footers. Think of any data 
that will be dynamically generated based on user form input. For example: user comments, uploaded images, credit cards, etc.
Obviously, all websites will need to manage users/password login information.

## Stretch Goals
Once your project is fully functional and demonstrates adequate scope, what extra features do you want to implement? What
additional gold plating would make your website utterly awesome? Stretch goals aren’t part of your grade; they are just for
your own satisfaction.

# Domain Name

All websites need a domain name. You will develop your website locally and host it GitHub (for now). Upon completion, you
retain rights to your creation, and have the option of hosting it on a separate server. You must find an unused domain name,
and if you decide to buy one, you must do it at your own expense.

Find an available domain name. For example: http://www.conradphotography.com, http://www.unclebobdentistry.net, etc.
You can check if a domain name is available using https://www.godaddy.com/domains/domain-name-search
