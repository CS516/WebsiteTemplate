## Homework 3: Website HTML and CSS

You have requirements and a mock-up of your website. You've practiced using HTML
and CSS on your previous homeworks and activities. You've read chapters 2 and
3, and should be getting into chapters 4 and 5. You have a development
environment on your computer and you are ready to start development of your project.

Start by creating "skeleton" pages; that is static HTML files  and position your
content, adding CSS as you go. This assignment is a checkpoint to make sure you
have a good start on the framework of your project, but tweaking your HTML and
CSS will be ongoing throughout the semester. You are never really "done".

## Learning Objectives

* Create a well-designed web site using semantic HTML and CSS.
* Use [HTML5 semantic elements](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/html-5-semantics/) for 
  [layout](layout).
* Use CSS to position and style elements on your website.

## HTML Requirements

Each page from your mock-up should be stubbed out. Don't worry if it doesn't
match your mock-up perfectly, but they should be fairly similar. Feel free to
add or remove pages if your requirements change. There should be no inline
styling in your HTML. All styling should be in your	CSS style sheets.

You must have at least the following to receive full credit for this assignment

- [ ] Favicon. You must include a favicon. (Quick Tip: [Adding a Favicon To Your
Website](http://www.dwuser.com/education/content/quick-tip-adding-a-favicon-to-your-website/))
- [ ] Header. Your header should be consistent across all pages and include
a logo that returns the user to your home page when clicked.
a navigation bar (each item in your navigation bar should be included in an
ordered or unordered list inside of an HTML5 <nav>).
the name/title of your website.
There are examples in the class GitHub repo that may be useful:
[html_css/layout](https://github.com/BoiseState/CS401-resources/tree/master/html_css/layout)
- [ ] Footer. Your footer should be consistent across all pages.
- [ ] Links. Your website must contain more than one page and pages should link
together via the navigation bar (and however else you see fit).
- [ ] Form Inputs. They shouldn't be functional yet, but they should be present on the
page.
- [ ] Static content. Include any images, text, etc. that you included in your
mock-up. This doesn't have to be perfect, but you should include some content.

## CSS Requirements

Create one or more style sheets. All styling (fonts, colors, padding, margins,
etc.) must be in a style sheet, or multiple files if you choose to organize them
as such.

- [ ] Style rules. Don't unnecessarily duplicate style rules.
class and id selectors. Your style classes and ids should be semantically named.
For example, if you	have a style to highlight certain <span> contents, don't
name the class "yellow", name it "highlight". In other words, name the style
based on its meaning. This is subjective, but do try to make it pretty, and easy
to use.
- [ ] Layout. It should be fluid, not rigid
(e.g. [should you use tables for layout?](http://shouldiusetablesforlayout.com/)).
Make the content adjust to the width of the browser. No unnecessary horizontal
scrollbars.
