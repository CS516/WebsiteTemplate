# Homework 5: PHP

Now that you have your static website completed, you will use PHP to eliminate
repeated HTML so we follow the DRY principle and use PHP to create a dynamic,
context-aware navigation bar so your users always know where they are. Note that
you could use JavaScript (or jQuery) for the navigation bar, but for the sake of
learning how to create dynamic pages using server-side scripting, you will do
this in PHP.

## Learning Objectives

* Apply basic PHP templating techniques to reduce repeated HTML in
headers/footers.
* Create dynamic, context-aware navigation using HTML, CSS, and PHP.


## Requirements

Add the following to your website to make it easier to maintain and more
user-friendly.

### PHP Templating

You will use the PHP include and/or require (and/or their "_once" variations) to
include repeated HTML in your files.

- [ ] If you haven't already, you will need to change your file extensions from .html
to .php.
- [ ] Create templates for at least the header/footer of each page.

### Context-aware Navigation

Use the technique described in this 
[Keeping Navigation Current With PHP](http://alistapart.com/article/keepingcurrent)
article (or your own idea) to keep your navigation bar up to date with the current
page.
