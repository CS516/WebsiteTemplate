# Homework 4: JavaScript/jQuery

Add JavaScript and/or jQuery to make your site "fancier" (i.e. make the user 
interface more user-friendly, more attractive, appear more responsive, etc.)

## Learning Objectives

* Identify uses for JavaScript (and jQuery) in web applications.
* Apply JavaScript (and jQuery) and/or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) to
make your web application more interactive and responsive.
* Demonstrate basic understanding of DOM manipulation.


## Requirements

You can use existing plugins or roll your own. What you do completely at your
discretion, but you must use it in some way. Here are a few examples (you don't
need to implement all of them):

* Client-side validation. Use jQuery to validate form input on the client. This
can make the user experience better by validating before making a request to the
server, or even before submitting the form.
* Fading effects. Most form submissions display some sort of status in a "flash"
message to the user. These say things like "Invalid user credentials" or "Your
post has been sent". You can use jQuery to make these message divs fade in and
out, or some other effect like scrolling off the page.
* Tooltips. If your site contains sections that could benefit from adding
additional information, such as instructions for new users, use jQuery to add
tooltips. These are obvious help buttons (like question marks) that, when
clicked, will pop-up a small box with useful information.
* Image Gallery. If your site contains a list of photos, like a photography
portfolio, consider using a jQuery plugin to make an image slider, rotator,
carousel, or some other appropriate effect.
* AJAX. Add Ajax to make your site feel more like an application. Eliminate page
reloads by making form posts and updates asynchronous. This will also help make
your site feel more responsive.
